# Python_Time_Logger
Just something I made for a comp-fluid dynamics job I'm working on

All you need is time, sys, os, and re for it to work, it should be entirely self contained.
All commands are lower case

Initial version: 6/3/19
-Logs time between "start" and "stop"
-Writes time to itself
-Fixed line 153 printing "Oof" instead of actually deleting stored time
-Added a way to disable 'fun' mode
-Reduced some redundancy
-Fixed some spelling errors
